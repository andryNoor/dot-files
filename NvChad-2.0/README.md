Target Location (Windows): %LocalAppData%\nvim\lua\[custom]
Target Location (*-Nix): ~/.config/nvim/lua/[custom]

Hint: Create symlink of contents of this directory ["custom"] to NvChad
Note:
- Currently I'm maintain this config on Windows 11
- Because I use this config (share it) between Win and Linux as well, so be careful when editing something. That's why just use symlink when possible and when have no specific config for certain OS
